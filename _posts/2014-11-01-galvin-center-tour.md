Join Net Impact for our November General Body Meeting followed by a tour of The Robert W. Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation at Illinois Institute of Technology. The Galvin Center is a major university initiative to improve the reliability, security, efficiency, and sustainability of the nation's electrical grid and overcome obstacles to the effective adoption and implementation of the Smart Grid.

The Center brings together researchers, industry, government, and innovators to "plug-in" to IIT's smart microgrid, research laboratories and technology park, creating a hub - or sandbox - for new innovations in advanced grid technology.
